# Fund-My-Cause

A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) network using [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) smart contracts. Fund-My-Cause lets anyone create a campaign on-chain, accept contributions in XLM or any Stellar token, and automatically release or refund funds based on whether the goal is met.

## How It Works

1. A creator deploys and initializes a campaign with a funding goal, deadline, and minimum contribution.
2. Contributors pledge tokens before the deadline.
3. If the goal is met by the deadline, the creator withdraws the funds (minus an optional platform fee).
4. If the goal is not met, each contributor individually claims their refund via a pull-based model.

## Smart Contract

The Soroban contract lives in `contracts/crowdfund/src/lib.rs` and exposes the following interface:

| Function                                                                                                          | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initialize(creator, token, goal, deadline, min_contribution, title, description, social_links, platform_config)` | Create a new campaign                                                         |
| `contribute(contributor, amount)`                                                                                 | Pledge tokens before the deadline                                             |
| `update_metadata(title, description, social_links)`                                                               | Update campaign metadata if status is Active                                  |

| `get_stats()`                                                                                                     | Returns `CampaignStats` (total raised, progress bps, contributor count, etc.) |
| `total_raised()`                                                                                                  | Current total raised                                                          |

| `deadline()`                                                                                                      | Campaign deadline (ledger timestamp)                                          |
| `contribution(contributor)`                                                                                       | Contribution amount for a specific address                                    |

### Pull-based Refund Model

Rather than a single transaction refunding all contributors (which would fail at scale), each contributor calls `refund_single` to claim their own refund. This is gas-efficient, scalable, and avoids a single point of failure.

### Platform Fee

An optional `PlatformConfig` can be set at initialization with a fee in basis points (e.g. `250` = 2.5%). The fee is deducted from the creator's payout on withdrawal and sent to the platform address.

---

## Frontend

The interface is a Next.js 16 app using the App Router, Tailwind CSS v4, and Freighter wallet integration.

Key components:

- `Navbar` — wallet connect/disconnect via Freighter
- `ProgressBar` — visual funding progress
- `CountdownTimer` — live countdown to campaign deadline
- `PledgeModal` — contribution flow with wallet auth

### Wallet Integration

The app uses `@stellar/freighter-api` for wallet connectivity. The `WalletContext` provider wraps the app and exposes `connect`, `disconnect`, `address`, and `signTx`.

---

## Prerequisites

### Contracts

| Requirement | Version | Installation |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 1.70+ | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| wasm32 target | - | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| Stellar CLI | 21.0+ | [Installation Guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli) |

### Frontend

| Requirement | Version | Installation |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| npm | 9+ | Included with Node.js |
| Freighter | Latest | [freighter.app](https://www.freighter.app/) |

### Optional

- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- GitHub CLI (for release automation)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fund-My-Cause/Fund-My-Cause.git
cd Fund-My-Cause
```

### 2. Build & test the contract

```bash
# Build WASM
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

### 3. Deploy to testnet

```bash
DEADLINE=$(date -d "+30 days" +%s)
./scripts/deploy.sh <CREATOR_ADDRESS> <TOKEN_ADDRESS> 1000 $DEADLINE 10 "My Campaign" "A great cause" null [REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID]
```

If `REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID` is omitted, the script deploys a new registry contract.
After campaign initialization, the script calls `registry.register(campaign_id)` automatically.

Save the printed `Contract ID` and `Registry ID` — you'll need them in frontend config.

### 4. Configure frontend environment

Use the environment switcher script:

```bash
# Switch to development environment
./scripts/switch-env.sh development

# Or manually create .env.local
cp apps/interface/.env.example apps/interface/.env.local
# Edit .env.local with your contract IDs
```

For detailed configuration options, see [docs/environment-config.md](./docs/environment-config.md).

### 5. Run the frontend

```bash
cd apps/interface
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Docker

> For the full deployment guide — environment variables, multi-stage build details, health checks, production hardening, and troubleshooting — see **[docs/docker.md](./docs/docker.md)**.

### Run with Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Copy and fill in your env vars
cp apps/interface/.env.example apps/interface/.env.local
# Edit apps/interface/.env.local with your contract ID and RPC URL

# 2. Build and start
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build the image manually

```bash
# Build context must be the repo root (monorepo workspace)
docker build -f apps/interface/Dockerfile -t fund-my-cause .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file apps/interface/.env.local fund-my-cause
```

### Multi-stage build

The Dockerfile uses a two-stage build to keep the production image small (~150–250 MB):

1. `builder` — installs all dependencies and compiles Next.js with `output: 'standalone'`
2. `runner` — copies only the standalone bundle; no source files or dev dependencies are shipped

### Key environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` | Yes | Crowdfund contract address |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL` | Yes | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | Yes | Stellar network passphrase |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL` | No | Horizon REST API endpoint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY` | No | Pinata IPFS key (image uploads) |

See [docs/docker.md](./docs/docker.md) for the full variable reference, health check setup, and production deployment considerations.

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows:

- `rust_ci.yml` — builds WASM + runs Rust tests on push/PR to `main`
- `frontend_ci.yml` — lints and typechecks the frontend on push/PR to `main`
- `playwright.yml` — runs Playwright E2E tests on PRs targeting `main`
- `deploy-testnet.yml` — deploys contracts to Stellar testnet on push to `develop`

Dependabot is configured to keep npm, Cargo, and GitHub Actions dependencies up to date weekly.

---

## Code Coverage

The frontend enforces a minimum **80% coverage threshold** across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines) via Jest. The build fails if any metric drops below this floor.

Run coverage locally:

```bash
cd apps/interface
npm run test:coverage
```

Thresholds are configured in `apps/interface/jest.config.js` under `coverageThreshold.global`.

## Reproducible Builds & Cargo.lock

`Cargo.lock` is **committed to this repository** intentionally.

For application binaries and smart contracts, locking every transitive dependency to an exact version is a security requirement — not optional. Without it:

- A `cargo build` on a different machine or at a later date may silently pull in a newer (potentially compromised or breaking) version of any dependency.
- Audits and vulnerability scans target specific versions; a floating lock file makes those results meaningless.
- Soroban WASM bytecode must be byte-for-byte reproducible so that on-chain contract hashes can be independently verified.

This follows the [Cargo book's recommendation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries) for binaries and aligns with Rust smart contract best practices.
